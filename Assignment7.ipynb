    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and \n",
    "behavior of the objects that will be created from it. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete\n",
    "entity that exists in memory and has its own unique set of values for the properties defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name. Within the class definition, we define the \n",
    "attributes (properties) and methods (behavior) of the class.\n",

    "    class Car:\n",

    "defined three methods: accelerate(), brake(), and get_speed().\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an object (instance) of the Car class by calling the class constructor and passing in values for the attributes:\n",
    "    my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)\n",
    "This creates a new instance of the Car class and assigns it to the variable my_car. We can then use the methods defined in\n",
    "the class to manipulate the object:\n",
    "    my_car.accelerate() # speed is now 10\n",
    "my_car.accelerate() # speed is now 20\n",
    "my_car.brake()      # speed is now 10\n",
    "print(my_car.get_speed()) # prints 10\n",
